<b>I</b>'ve been thinking lately, after attending many hackathons this year, about how many people are actually interested in combining software development, sound, and music. Whether it was for a hack,  a mobile application or simple browser-based audio manipulations, people were genuinely interested in connecting these fields. If we were to take a look at companies like Shazam, Soundcloud, Spotify, StingRay to name a few, we would come to realize that all these companies have technologies based on either music, audio, code or the combination of all three!

Also, a new demand for intelligent, autonomous music teachers is dominating the world of web and iOS applications. Top grossing apps such Melodic and Yousician offer users flexibility to practice and learn new instruments from the comfort of their homes.

### What's the point?

I remember how our group faced many problems when it came down to audio and code manipulations while building Muvic. As we searched for solutions, we realized how much the information was dispersed and outdated, nothing was concrete, and it was very difficult to find good reliable sources to help us achieve what we were trying to do. Till this day, I have yet to find a dependable community dedicated to solving problems related to the combination of these fields.

This is why I will use this post to serve as a checklist for new ideas I want to tackle this year. In short, I want to dedicate some time to growing and nurturing a community in this domain. I want to devote more blog posts related to relevant topics in research, code implementation and potential future projects. I would also like to create a local meetup group to gather developers, producers, and artists to have discussions and talks based on these topics.

### Why?

Personally, I've always been passionate about creating and composing music. Before immersing myself in coding and software development, I programmed music. This year, I took it upon myself to learn two new things: Swift for iOS development and Logic Pro X (as I recently switched over from Ableton Live).

After attending HackHarvard this year, I've come to realize how much I enjoyed creating native iOS Applications. Before the hackathon, I had never written a line of code using Swift. xCode, Swift, Pods, these words meant nothing to me! A few workshops and a couple of tutorials later, I fell in love.

### Next Steps...

This is why I made it a goal for this year to learn Swift and particularly, iOS development.

I want to hear from artists, musicians, developers, label managers, producers and other industry experts. I want to learn about there pains, the obstacles that prevent them from doing something in their day to day business.
