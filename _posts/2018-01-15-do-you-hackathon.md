<b>A</b> few years ago, a good friend of mine kept pushing me to register for something called a hackathon - an event that combines designers, developers and other domain experts with the goal of creating and building something, from nothing, within 24 to 36 hours and present the final product to a judging panel.

_Sounds cool right..?_

Here's a little snippet of my experience :neckbeard:<br><br>

### Don't be discouraged by rejection

In my first-year in software engineering, I applied and was rejected twice while most my friends got in. It <b>crushed</b> me. I promised myself that the next time I applied to any hackathon, I was going to be accepted.



> _"That same year, I applied and finally got accepted to Hack the North."_

### One time and you're hooked

After attending <a class="pink-hover" href="https://hackthenorth.com/" target="_blank">Hack the North</a>, I was hooked. It was one of the most fun and productive weekends of my life! It was truly a remarkable experience; from meeting like-minded individuals to attending workshops and talks with industry leaders, to the variety of sponsors, swag, food: it was mind-blowing!

It was clear to me; I needed to attend more hackathons. I made it a goal to participate in 1-2 hackathon every six months. I attended <a class="pink-hover" href="http://hackharvard.io/" target="_blank">HackHarvard</a> shortly after and will be participating at <a class="pink-hover" href="https://conuhacks.io/" target="_blank">ConUHacks</a> at the end of the month.
