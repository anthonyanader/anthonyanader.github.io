<b>W</b>hat a semester that was :expressionless:

>Described in one word: _treacherous_.

I believe it's because the summer course load is like any other semester but instead of a four-month term, with breaks in-between, we only have eleven weeks to complete all of our assignments, labs, projects, midterms, and finals. _excruciating_. I also mentioned in my last post that I had the opportunity to co-found a startup during that period which was one of the best decisions I took but, of course, I suffered in school for it :p totally worth it!

> What are my plans for the next month?

### 1. Prepare a research proposal for next semester
I am planning to research "Sentiment Analysis" under the supervision of professor <a class="pink-hover" href="http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~halosman/" target="_blank">Hussein Al Ossman</a>. It's a very interesting sub-domain of machine learning that involves training a model to gain a deeper understanding and meaning from text. I have the rest of the summer to decide whether I want to implement the project using <a class="pink-hover" href="https://reactjs.org" target="_blank">React</a> or <a class="pink-hover" href="https://rubyonrails.org" target="_blank">Rails</a>. I've been wanting to write code in Ruby and learn to build a web app using Rails 5 for some time now. On the other hand, I had the chance to explore React for a <a class="pink-hover" href="https://github.com/anthonyanader/flavorHubFrontEnd" target="_blank">DB project</a>; I loved it, it was super flexible and convenient, and one can find many resources for help. On the flip side, it's super new, practices and best standards are still being developed causing projects to lack in standards and consistent structures.

### 2. Neappoli
We have finally released our iOS application for the City of Ottawa!

### 3. Plan a one week trip with the family

### 4.Wedding Season
