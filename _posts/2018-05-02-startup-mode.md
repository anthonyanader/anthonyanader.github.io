<b>S</b>pring is upon us, and here I thought I could take a small breather from school before the summer semester begins... I guess not since today was my first day back to school, right after finishing my last final exam two days ago :expressionless:

I say this because I love breaks! They give me the opportunity to work on something I love and passionate about. My mind isn't cluttered with school material; I can use my creativity to its fullest. The last break I had was Christmas, and I was able to build and design this whole website during those two weeks off!

> Needless to say, I wish I had some time off before starting the summer session.


<b>But</b>, something really awesome happened right after my last exam. Sometimes all it takes is one coffee with the right person, and a new opportunity could open its doors. I found myself turning down a part-time job at the university to join a government-funded startup while attending school full-time! I am super excited! The workload will be _humongous_, no doubt about it, but I believe when you are building something that will touch the lives of others and do good to the community, nothing can stop you.
