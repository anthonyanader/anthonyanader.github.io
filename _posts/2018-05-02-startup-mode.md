<b>S</b>pring is upon us, and here I thought I could take a small breather from school before the summer semester begins... I guess not since today was my first day back to school, right after finishing my last final exam two days ago :expressionless:

I say this because I love breaks; they give me the opportunity to work on something I love. My mind isn't cluttered with school material; I can use my creativity to its fullest. The last break I had was Christmas, and I was able to build and design this whole website during those two weeks off!

> Needless to say, I wish I had some time off before starting the summer session.
