I pledged to read 25 books during the <span>[*2017 Reading Challenge*](https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/show/5493-2017-reading-challenge)</span> of goodreads. To keep things interesting, I read business or self-improvement books in the morning while eating breakfast and indulged in high fantasy or fiction books for leisure at the end of the day. Finally, I aimed for at least one technical book per quarter geared towards my field of study.

I used [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com) to not only keep track of my reading habits but to also discover new books (many who've now become my favourites). I highly recommend setting up a goodreads account because it helps find new hidden gems and connect with fellow readers/authors. One of the feautures offered by goodreads is the opportunity to compare books and reviews with your friends. Alright, so here are my 5 top books for 2017:


##### 1. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck - Mark Manson
##### 2. Origin - Dan Brown
##### 3. The Tipping Point - Malcolm Gladwell
##### 4. Sapiens - Yuval Noah Harari
##### 5. Quiet - Susan Cain
