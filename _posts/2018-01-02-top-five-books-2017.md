I accomplished my pledge of reading 25 books during the goodreads <a class="pink-hover" href="https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/show/5493-2017-reading-challenge" target="_blank">2017 Reading Challenge</a>. To keep things interesting, I read business or self-improvement books in the morning while eating breakfast and indulged in high fantasy or fiction books for leisure at the end of the day. Finally, I aimed for at least one technical book per quarter geared towards my field of study.

I strongly believe in:

> "you cannot improve what you don't measure"

so, I used <a class="pink-hover" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41290787-anthony-a-nader" target="_blank">goodreads</a> not only to keep track of my progress but to also discover new books and authors. Another neat feature of this platform is personal shelves; it allows you to categorize your books in "to-read," "read" and "reading" which motivates you to finish the book you started and to look forward to the next book you'll pick up. Alright, here we go, my top 5 books for 2017:


##### 1. <b>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck</b> - _Mark Manson_

I remember being skeptical when I picked up this book for the first time - "what's with all these cheesy titles." But I was hooked right after the first page. A real page-turner, written in an informal tone that anyone can appreciate. Quick and easy read, highly recommended to anyone, you'll truly enjoy this one!

Favourite quote:

> “To be happy we need something to solve. Happiness is therefore a form of action;” -Mark Manson


##### 2. <b>Origin</b> - _Dan Brown_

Ok, maybe I'm a little biased because Dan Brown happens to be one of my favorite authors; I voted Origins as my #1 fiction book for 2017. Such a progressive ideology behind this book, truly the two questions we have been asking ourselves since the beginning of time:

> "Where do we come from and where are we going?

It's another excellent addition to the Robert Langdon character progression with another mix of real history combined with tomorrow's AI capabilities.

##### 3. <b>The Tipping Point</b> - _Malcolm Gladwell_

> Small changes can make a big difference.

The title says it all: a book packed with examples and anecdotes that demonstrate how impacts which seem small and insignificant, can cause a tremendous shift in the outcome of an event.

I had previously read "Outsiders" by the same author and since I've become very fond of Malcolm's writing style and research aptitude.

##### 4. Sapiens - Yuval Noah Harari


##### 5. Quiet - Susan Cain
