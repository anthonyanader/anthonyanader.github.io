<b>T</b>he past two-three weeks were pretty painful. It’s mid-semester, all our lab reports and assignments are due before reading week. Once we're back, it’s back-to-back midterms for four consecutive days including Saturday. Since this semester’s exams were all planned the week after reading week, instead of working on side projects or honing a hobby/craft, even resting, no, we are stuck cramming and studying day and night. Again, all side projects, blogging, producing and pretty much anything fun comes to a halt. It’s just how it is during midterms and finals.

I am dedicating this blog post to my future self on how I kept my sanity and stress levels low during this period. I also want to come back to this post one day and see what I learned, what I can do differently and especially how I can improve for the few future semesters left.

### Routine

<b>4 AM</b> - I woke up at 4:00 AM every day of the week except weekends, where I turn the alarm off and wake up naturally  around 6:30-7:00 AM. _Why 4 AM_? Waking up before anyone in their right mind is up is invigorating. Another major plus is that I live in the heart of downtown, so it’s busy and loud, traffic noises, emergency services, buses, you name it— noise never stops! Hence, waking up at 4 gives me a few quiet hours of work before anyone else is up to do some of my most important, challenging/difficult/energy consuming tasks.

<b>6 AM</b> - The gym opens up at that time. I get my daily 45-minutes training done during that time. I go for a HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) which helps me maximize my time, get the metabolism up to speed early in the morning and also I don’t have to think about working out for the rest of the day. On a more stressful day and/or weekends, I usually go for an evening strength-training workout.

<b>7-8 AM</b> - Breakfast, business book read, coffee and shower.

<b>8 AM - 5 PM</b> - Study time using the Pomodoro Technique with an hour break for lunchtime.
