<b>A</b>s promised in a previous blog post, I began documenting my learning journey in iOS development. Despite living through the stress of the end of the semester; last-minute posted assignments, projects presentations, and not to mention finals starting next week, I was still able to get up at 4-5AM and work toward something Iâ€™m passionate about before starting my school day.
