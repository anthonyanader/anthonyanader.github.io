<b>W</b>e are currently one and a half month into the summer semester, and the workload has become _nextLevel()_. One thing I am pleased about is that I have pledged to the #100DaysOfCode challenge for the second time this year and with the current course selection I can commit code <b>every.</b> <b>single.</b> <b>day</b>. From writing C code for an OS course to learning how to write unit tests using every suite available (JUnit, PyUnite, ECLEmma, etc.) and finally, to using the Android SDK in a week to develop @tip.io.
