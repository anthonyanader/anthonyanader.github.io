                    <p class="story-text"><b>I</b>'ve always been drawn to music regardless of the professional path chosen. It wasn't just listening or identifying to particular genres; I was captivated by sound. </p>

                    <p class="story-text"><b>A</b>t an early age, I learned to compose and produce music. The best way to describe my creative process stems from writing melodies, sequencing, and mixing individual instruments to create songs. In 2013,  I released my first two records under the CONCEPT (CAN) alias: <a class="pink-hover" href="https://www.beatport.com/track/what-is-deep-original-mix/4633300" target="_blank">"What's Deep"</a> on Black Swan Recordings and <a class="pink-hover" href="https://www.beatport.com/track/that-feeling-original-mix/4915120" target="_blank">"That Feeling"</a> on Shinshy Records.</p>

                    <p class="story-text"><b>I</b> complimented my artistic venture with a business degree from John Molson School of Business (Concordia). Once I graduated, I had a decision to make, either pursue a master's degree in business studies or, go down an entirely different and technical path. I chose the latter and moved to Ottawa to pursue an engineering degree.</p>

                    <p class="story-text"><b>W</b>hy software engineering? Writing code is a lot like art to me. It's an iterative, creative process, and in my head, it's not much different from programming music: patterns, layers, sequences; abstraction is the same in both worlds!</p>

                    <p class="story-text"><b>TL;DR</b> In 2019, I will be graduating as a software engineer from the University of Ottawa. I would describe myself as a full-time learner and solution-oriented technology enthusiast passionate about building creative products that solve complex problems.</p>
